# Sudoku Solver
In this mini project we made a java app to get an unsolved sudoku puzzle and return the solved sudoku. If there are more than one possible solution then it returns an arbitary one and if there are none, it gives a relvant message.  
The initial version is a console version and we are using java fx to add graphics to it.  
Also as of now it uses hand-written algorithms to solve the sudoku but we are planning on making a version where we use ML to solve it automatically.
